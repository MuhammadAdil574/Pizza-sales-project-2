# Pizza-sales-project-2
Analysis for Pizza Sales
This project analyzes pizza sales data to gain insights into customer preferences, trends, and revenue distribution. The analysis is divided into three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, each progressively exploring more complex aspects of the data. The project utilizes SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the sales database, which contains tables related to orders, pizzas, pizza types, and their respective categories.
